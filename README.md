# Optimization by example 

## [1. Inverse problem](https://github.com/hanyoseob/lecture_optimization/blob/main/chapter01_Inverse_problem.ipynb)
> We will learn a concept of `the inverse problem` and explain how to solve the inverse problems depending on a system condition.

## [2. Optimiziation problem](https://github.com/hanyoseob/lecture_optimization/blob/main/chapter02_Optimization_problem.ipynb)
> We will learn a concept of `the optimization problem` to solve the inverse problem and implement `the gradient descent method` which is one of the optimization solvers.
