# Author

Hello, I'm `Yoseob Han` who is postdoctoral researcher in Harvard medical school and Massachusetts general hospital.

I run [Youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCpujNlw4SUpgTU5rrDXH0Jw) to handle deep learning, signal processing, and optimization.
You can easily learn above topics through practice, and all the source codes are uploaded [HERE](https://github.com/hanyoseob).

I have a plan to make a lecture according to an advanced medical imaging processing related to computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and will upload the lectures into new additional repository.

Since all the lectures were written by myself, there may be erroneous explanations.
If you find wrong parts, please let me know.

# Optimization by example 

Here, I will explain the basic concept of the optimization and address how to solve the real world problems like vision- and medical-imaging tasks using the optimization methods.

## CONTENTS

### [1. Inverse problem](https://github.com/hanyoseob/lecture_optimization/blob/main/chapter01_Inverse_problem.ipynb)
> We learn a concept of `the inverse problem` and explain how to solve the inverse problems depending on a system condition.

### [2. Optimiziation problem](https://github.com/hanyoseob/lecture_optimization/blob/main/chapter02_Optimization_problem.ipynb)
> We learn a concept of `the optimization problem` to solve the inverse problem and implement `the gradient descent method` to solve toy-example.

### [3. Gradient descent method]() (In progress)
> We implement `the gradient descent method` to restore a clean image from a blurred image by Gaussian kernel.
