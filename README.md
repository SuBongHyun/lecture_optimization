# Author

Hello, I'm `Yoseob Han` who is postdoctoral researcher in Harvard medical school and Massachusetts general hospital.

I am running [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCpujNlw4SUpgTU5rrDXH0Jw) to address `deep learning`, `signal processing`, and `optimization`.
You can easily learn above topics through practice, and all the source codes are uploaded [HERE](https://github.com/hanyoseob).

I am also preparing `a simple parallel computing course using CUDA`.

In addition, I have a plan to make a lecture according to `an advanced medical imaging processing` related to computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and will upload the lecture in a new repository.

Since all the lectures were written by myself, there may be erroneous explanations.
If you find wrong parts, please let me know.

___If you like the lectures, please `click on the star` and `follow` [GitHub](https://github.com/hanyoseob), and `subscribe` to my [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCpujNlw4SUpgTU5rrDXH0Jw).___

# Optimization by example 

Here, I will explain the basic concept of the optimization and address how to solve the real world problems like vision- and medical-imaging tasks using the optimization methods.

## Contents

### [1. Inverse problem](https://github.com/hanyoseob/lecture_optimization/blob/main/chapter01_Inverse_problem.ipynb)
> We learn a concept of `the inverse problem` and explain how to solve the inverse problems depending on a system condition.

### [2. Optimiziation problem](https://github.com/hanyoseob/lecture_optimization/blob/main/chapter02_Optimization_problem.ipynb)
> We learn a concept of `the optimization problem` to solve the inverse problem and implement `the gradient descent method` to solve toy-example.

### [3. Gradient descent method](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1tlOUw92mmyWnUW2f72DfeR0EK8RhkKtT)
> We implement `the gradient descent method` to solve the inversion problem of 2D cases.

### [4. Gradient descent method for practice]() (In progress)
> We implement `the gradient descent method` to deblur the blurred image by the known 2D Gaussain kernel.
